This repository contains scripts used in our paper "Natural selection acting on complex traits hampers the predictive accuracy of polygenic scores in ancient samples" [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2025.05.009].

simulations/ contain all the scripts to replicate the simulations performed in this analysis. For details on running each script see simulations/sim_any_evo_dynamic.sh.

scripts/ contain all the scripts to replicate the ancient-phenotype prediction analyses performed for each simulation. The output of the SLiM simulations created from the simulations/ folder can be read using the script pipeline_any_evo_dynamic.R to calculate the r2, MSE and Bias, as well as QTLs effect sizes distribution.

figures/ contain all the scripts to replicate the figures in the paper.

For any questions please contact Valeria AÃ±orve-Garibay at valeria_anorve_garibay@brown.edu or valeria.anorvegaribay@gmail.com :).
